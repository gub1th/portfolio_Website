                    <p>This was a project that I did during HackCMU. Our team took a more chill/relaxed approach for this hackathon, which is reflected
                        in the simplicity and straightforwardness of our app.

                        In this technologically driven world, many are forced to adapt to changes or be left in the dust. Grandmas who grew up getting
                        their weather news from the newspaper had to eventually adapt themselves to get news from the TV. However, getting news from 
                        the TV only requires the click of a few buttons, compared to getting your weather news from the internet. The Internet is full 
                        of so many things that a 70 year old grandma can't possibly pick up on in her lifespan. Thus, we introduce to you Go Weather.com, 
                        where we simplify the weather news process. Simply type in your city, and click "Get my weather today!" to get your weather news. 
                        It's that easy! Grandmas all over the world no longer need to fret about working the Internet when they have this nifty tool for them!</p>
